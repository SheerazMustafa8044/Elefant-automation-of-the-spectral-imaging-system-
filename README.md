# Elefant-automation-of-the-spectral-imaging-system-
Elefant is a project to detect microplastic on surfaces, e.g. beaches. It is based on the dection of flurescence of materials. A UV-source exitits the materials. The emitted exited materials are photographed serval times with different spectral filters. This allows to discrimate between plastic and non-plastic materials.
